description: Passage from "Notes on Nationalism".

> &ldquo;A nationalist is one who thinks solely, or mainly, in terms of competitive prestige. He may be a
> positive or a negative nationalist—that is, he may use his mental energy either in boosting or in
> denigrating—but at any rate his thoughts always turn on victories, defeats, triumphs and humiliations. He
> sees history, especially contemporary history, as the endless rise and decline of great power units and
> every event that happens seems to him a demonstration that his own side is on the upgrade and some hated
> rival is on the downgrade. But finally, it is important not to confuse nationalism with mere worship of
> success. The nationalist does not go on the principle of simply ganging up with the strongest side. On the
> contrary, having picked his side, he persuades himself that it is the strongest and is able to stick to his
> belief even when the facts are overwhelmingly against him.&rdquo;
