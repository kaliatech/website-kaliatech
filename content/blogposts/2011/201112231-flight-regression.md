Flight Regression was a small consulting business around taking raw data from general aviation flight accidents,
applying computer analysis to that data, and then generating multimedia reconstructions.

The most compelling reconstruction was done using Google Earth. It combined radar path animation, audio, and
transcripts. It became defunct when Google decided to deprecate the Google Earth browser plugin. As an aside, this led
to <a href="https://github.com/codyogden/killedbygoogle/pull/320">my first contribution</a>
to <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">killedbygoogle</a>.

## Demonstration Videos

These videos show software I developed before "single-page-application" was a common term.

Most of this website is no longer functional, but it still gives some sense to how things worked.
