          Here are my first tests using the <a href="https://www.theupsstore.com/print/3d-printing">3D printing
            services</a> now offered at the local UPS store.

          These objects are connectors for combining Legos and Lincoln Logs. Many more similar type connectors are
          available for download as part of the <a href="http://fffff.at/free-universal-construction-kit/">Free
            Universal Construction Set</a>.

          The UPS stores are using <a href="http://www.stratasys.com/3d-printers/uprint-se-plus">Stratus uPrint Plus
            SE</a> printers. Maximum print size is 8 x 8 x 6 inches.

          The UPS stores take .STL files. I use <a href="https://www.alibre.com/">Alibre Parameteric CAD</a> for
          creating custom models, but a simpler, cheaper option for designing models that can be exported to STL is
          <a href="https://www.sketchup.com/">SketchUp</a>. Cost is calculated based on how much material will be needed
          in cubic centimeters per their software, and printing is prepaid. Multiple colors are supported, but each
          color change incurs a $25 fee. These two pieces required about 3 hours to print and cost ~$40USD.

          My test was to see if the resolution of the studs was enough to allow a solid Lego connection. Test
          successful.
