            Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but
            will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not
            want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that
            will live on in the memories of your loved ones.

        The opposite of the religious fanatic is not the fanatical atheist but the gentle cynic who cares not whether
        there is a god or not.

        — Eric Hoffer

        I asked him if he would come up with a few options. And he said, “No. I will solve your problem for you. And you
        will pay me. And you don’t have to use the solution. If you want options, go talk to other people. But I’ll
        solve
        your problem for you the best way I know how. And you use it or not. That’s up to you. You’re the client. But
        you
        pay me.” And there was a clarity about the relationship that was refreshing.

        Nothing in the world can take the place of Persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than
        unsuccessful
        men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full
        of
        educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan ‘Press On’ has solved and
        always will solve the problems of the human race.

        — Calvin Coolidge

        Cynicism is a sorry kind of wisdom.

        — Barack Obama?

        —————————————————-

        Anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life,
        nurtured
        by the false notion that democracy means that ‘my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.’

        — Isaac Asimov

        —————————————————-

        Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able?
        Then he is not omnipotent.
        Is he able, but not willing?
        Then he is malevolent.
        Is he both able and willing?
        Then whence cometh evil?
        Is he neither able nor willing?
        Then why call him God?

        — Epicurus

        —————————————————-

        Because we don’t know when we will die, we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well. And yet everything
        happens only a certain number of times, and a very small number really. How many more times will you remember a
        certain afternoon of your childhood, an afternoon that is so deeply a part of your being that you can’t even
        conceive of your life without it? Perhaps four, or five times more? Perhaps? not even that. How many more times
        will you watch the full moon rise? Perhaps twenty. And yet it all seems limitless.

        — Paul Bowles – The Sheltering Sky

        —————————————————-

        It’s like the universe screams in your face, ‘Do you know what I am, how grand I am, how old I am? Can you even
        comprehend what I am? What are you, compared to me?’ And when you know enough science, you can just smile up at
        the universe and reply, ‘Dude, I am you.’

        I sold [MicroSolutions] after 7 years and made enough money to take time off and have a whole lot of fun. Back
        then I can remember vividly people telling me how lucky I was to sell my business at the right time. Then when I
        took that money and started trading technology stocks that were in the areas that MicroSolutions focused on, I
        remember vividly being told how lucky I was to have expertise in such a hot area, as technology stocks started
        to
        trade up. Of course, no one wanted to comment on how lucky I was to spend time reading software manuals, or
        Cisco
        Router manuals, or sitting in my house testing and comparing new technologies, but that’s a topic for another
        blog
        post.
