          I took kt004 to the electronics recycling plant over the weekend. This was a high-end laptop bought while
          working at IconMedialab in St. Louis. It built the Wear-Dated RFID kiosk, held Prada docs, weathered a few
          electric shorts due to bad soldering on my part, etc. It was still working fine, though running Linux these
          days.

          There are zero scratches on the LCD due to my use of the original packing material every time the lid was
          closed. (This was before the laptop manufacturers got wise and started putting rubber stoppers to prevent
          keyboards from rubbing screen.)

          I just didn’t need it any more, nor did I know anyone else that could use it.

          I get attached to my hardware. I suppose it won’t be missed, but it was definitely part of my history.
