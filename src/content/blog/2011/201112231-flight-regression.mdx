Flight Regression was a small consulting business around taking raw data from general aviation flight accidents,
applying computer analysis to that data, and then generating multimedia reconstructions.

The most compelling reconstruction was done using Google Earth. It combined radar path animation, audio, and
transcripts. It became defunct when Google decided to deprecate the Google Earth browser plugin. As an aside, this led
to [my first contribution](https://github.com/codyogden/killedbygoogle/pull/320)
to [killedbygoogle](https://killedbygoogle.com/).

## Demonstration Videos

I previously had YouTube videos showing the 3D GoogleEarth software in action. It included a animated flight path and
transcript synchronized to audio. It was a single-page-application before SPA was a common term. However, during the
great google account purge of early 2020, I lost access to the account and Google subsequently deleted all of my
videos. Lessons learned.

These videos show software I developed before "single-page-application" was a common term.
