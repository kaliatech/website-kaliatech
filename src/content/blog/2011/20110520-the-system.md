> &ldquo;To speak of certain government and establishment institutions as “the system” is to speak correctly.
> … They are sustained by structural relationships even when they have lost all other meaning and purpose.
> People arrive at a factory and perform a totally meaningless task from eight to five without question
> because the structure demands that it be that way. There’s no villain, no “mean guy” who wants them to live
> meaningless lives, it’s just that the structure, the system demands it and no one is willing to take on the
> formidable task of changing the structure just because it is meaningless.
>
> But to tear down a factory or to revolt against a government or to avoid repair of a motorcycle because it
> is a system is to attack effects rather than causes; and as long as the attack is upon effects only, no
> change is possible. The true system, the real system, is our present construction of systematic thought
> itself, rationality itself, and if a factory is torn down but the rationality which produced it is left
> standing, then that rationality will simply produce another factory. If a revolution destroys a systematic
> government, but the systematic patterns of thought that produced that government are left intact, then those
> patterns will repeat themselves in the succeeding government. There’s so much talk about the system. And so
> little understanding.&rdquo;
