  <p class="quote">
    Live a good life.<br />
    If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you
    based on the virtues you have lived by. <br />
    If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. <br />
    If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the
    memories of your loved ones.

  <p class="quote">
    I asked him if he would come up with a few options. And he said, “No. I will solve your problem for you. And
    you will pay me. And you don’t have to use the solution. If you want options, go talk to other people. But
    I’ll solve your problem for you the best way I know how. And you use it or not. That’s up to you. You’re the
    client. But you pay me.” And there was a clarity about the relationship that was refreshing.

  <p class="quote">
    Nothing in the world can take the place of Persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than
    unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not;
    the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan
    ‘Press On’ has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.

    Anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life,
    nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that ‘my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.’

  <p class="quote">
    Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able?<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Then he is not omnipotent.<br />
    Is he able, but not willing?<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Then he is malevolent.<br />
    Is he both able and willing?<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Then whence cometh evil?<br />
    Is he neither able nor willing?<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Then why call him God?

  <p class="quote">
    Because we don’t know when we will die, we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well. And yet everything
    happens only a certain number of times, and a very small number really. How many more times will you
    remember a certain afternoon of your childhood, an afternoon that is so deeply a part of your being that you
    can’t even conceive of your life without it? Perhaps four, or five times more? Perhaps? not even that. How
    many more times will you watch the full moon rise? Perhaps twenty. And yet it all seems limitless.

  <p class="quote">
    It’s like the universe screams in your face, ‘Do you know what I am, how grand I am, how old I am? Can you
    even comprehend what I am? What are you, compared to me?’ And when you know enough science, you can just
    smile up at the universe and reply, ‘Dude, I am you.’

    I sold [MicroSolutions] after 7 years and made enough money to take time off and have a whole lot of fun.
    Back then I can remember vividly people telling me how lucky I was to sell my business at the right time.
    Then when I took that money and started trading technology stocks that were in the areas that MicroSolutions
    focused on, I remember vividly being told how lucky I was to have expertise in such a hot area, as
    technology stocks started to trade up. Of course, no one wanted to comment on how lucky I was to spend time
    reading software manuals, or Cisco Router manuals, or sitting in my house testing and comparing new
    technologies, but that’s a topic for another blog post.
