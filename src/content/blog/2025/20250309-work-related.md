# Work Related Artifacts

The [company](https://shield.ai) I worked for from 2023 to 2025 is [now valued at $5.3 billion](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/shield-ai-raises-240m-at-5-3b-valuation-to-scale-hivemind-enterprise-an-ai-powered-autonomy-developer-platform-302393843.html). That valuation was announced just last week, along with a website update showcasing their new product offerings. I wasn’t involved in the website refresh. I was working behind the scenes on prototypes and new product offerings.

If you’re curious about some of what I was doing, the new website is actually a good place to start:

</figure>

...I can’t say how long this will remain on the website. My name and the dates likely slipped in there by accident, but they do point to my involvement. I can’t claim credit for everything shown, but I was a key designer and developer behind some of the functionality featured in those screenshots. The date format in a few screenshots is one I’m somewhat notorious for promoting. Small wins.
