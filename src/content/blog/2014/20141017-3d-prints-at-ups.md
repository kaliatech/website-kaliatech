      Here are my first tests using the
      <a href="https://www.theupsstore.com/print/3d-printing">3D printing services</a>
      now offered at the local UPS store.

      These objects are connectors for combining Legos and Lincoln Logs. Many similar type connectors are
      available for download as part of the
      <a href="http://fffff.at/free-universal-construction-kit/">Free Universal Construction Set</a>
      .

      The UPS stores are using
      <a href="https://support.stratasys.com/en/printers/fdm-legacy/uprint">Stratus uPrint Plus SE</a>
      printers. Maximum print size is 8 x 8 x 6 inches.
    </p>
    <p>
      The UPS stores take .STL files. I use
      <a href="https://www.alibre.com/">Alibre Parametric CAD</a>
      for creating custom models, but a simpler, cheaper option for designing models that can be exported to STL is
      <a href="https://www.sketchup.com/">SketchUp</a>
      . Cost is calculated based on how much material will be needed in cubic centimeters per their software, and
      printing is prepaid. Multiple colors are supported, but each color change incurs a $25 fee. These two pieces
      required about 3 hours to print and cost ~$40USD.

      My test was to see if the resolution of the studs was enough to allow a solid Lego connection. Test
      successful.
