**UPDATE [2023]:** _Understanding and perceptions around Agile and Scrum practices have been so convoluted that I no
longer want to be associated with them. The [agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) is still
good. However, the attempted applications of it in larger organizations and consultancies? ...not so much._

There are my notes regarding Scrum processes for software development. I've written some variant of these notes for
multiple companies, primarily to establish guidelines around point estimates for teams that are new to Scrum.

I am not an expert on Agile or Scrum practices. Every team and project is different. I believe that software dev teams
should strive for self-management and keep ceremony to a minimum. But, it takes time for a team to learn to work
together, and guidelines like these can help get started.

## Point Guidelines

Reasons for estimating with points:

- As developers, there should be a general agreement on the level of effort that will be needed to complete a given
  story. Agreement helps with estimation accuracy and making sure the story is sufficiently defined.
- As managers and planners, point related metrics will become useful for estimating and prioritizing future work.

Point values, velocity, & capacity are relative to a team and have little meaning outside that team. I am providing
my suggestions here as a starting point for point values, but these are only suggestions.

I like using the Fibonacci sequence (or a doubling sequence) because it helps to remember that the point values are
completely relative. Point values should be representation of complexity and effort for the team to complete. They do
not always map to time-to-complete, but in practice, that's usually the most useful way to estimate.

These guidelines assume 2-week sprints.

### 1 Point

A story or task that needs to be tracked, but it will only take a minute or two for someone to complete. No risks. No
questions.

### 2 Points

Not 1 and not 3. Should only take a few minutes. Many teams don't bother using 2 point values when using Fibonacci
scale.

### 3 Points

Will usually take someone an hour or so. No risks. No questions.

### 5 points

Will usually take someone a few hours or full day to complete. Might have to ping someone else a few times. Little risk.
No real questions.

### 8 points

Probably take a few days, or even a full week to complete. Might involve more than person. Maybe some minor risks once
work is started. Not too many questions.

### 13 points

Probably take at least a week to complete. Might involve more than one person. Probably has risks and questions that
might develop after work begins.

### 21 points

Expect it will take the entire sprint. Might involve more than one person. Probably has risks and more questions once
work begins. However, this could also simply be an effort-intensive development task that will need the full sprint.

### 21+

Generally unused. If team can not estimate a story at 21 or less, then the story should be researched and/or broken down
further before being moved in to the sprint.

### \{SPIKE\}

A story/task tracking the effort needed to better understand something before it can be estimated. Said another way, we
don't know what we don't know. This usually involves research or cross team commu-nications. Team might try assigning
point values based on a suggested time box.

### \{BUG\}

Sometimes the effort needed to address and fix a reported bug can be estimated, and sometimes it cannot. At least, not
until the underlying bug cause has been determined. Sometimes bugs are dependent on waiting for customer feedback and
follow-ups, which can also generally not be estimated.

## Related Thoughts

### Cross Product/Projects

Scrum is not great for working across multiple projects. Generally, scrum expects a cross-functional team (and
associated sprint board) to be working on a single project at a time. Reality is often different. But, I think that is
important to remember than when figuring out how best to apply Scrum based practices and tools in a team environment.

### Context Switching

Related to previous point, context switching often has a significant cost. A developer being asked to work across
multiple projects in a sprint will not be able to complete the same amount of work as when they are focused on a single
project. That is true for the team as a whole too. That should be considered in any future capacity planning.

### Spikes

It will often be the case, especially early on, that a team will have stories that can not be accurately estimated
because they don't know what they don't know. That makes it hard to assign points and track capacity/velocity. Teams
sometimes call stories of this sort "spikes". It has been recommended to me that when doing this, the spike be time
boxed. For example, do R&D for ~3 days and then report status and results so team can decide how best to continue.

### Tools

It is my belief that the available tools for scrum team management aren't great. They often add overhead and friction to
teams that need to be quickly adapting as projects continue to move forward and new information is gained. I try and
always remember that the goal with these processes is to be constantly moving forward, supporting management's need for
forward-looking planning, and trying not to stress too much. The goal should never be the process itself.

The limitations of the tools should be taken in to consideration when figuring how best to apply processes. There can be
a natural tension between wanting to do the work someone _knows_ needs to be done, and tracking that accurately
according to the work someone _said_ was going to be done.

### Point Accuracy

Assigning points to stories should be done by multiple developers looking at a story and providing their best guess as
to the complexity/required-effort for the team to complete the story. The estimate should be as if that story would be
the only focus within a sprint (even if that is almost never the case). Coming up with point values should not take a
significant amount of time and no one should expect point values to be overly accurate. The nature of software
development work makes consistently accurate estimates almost impossible.

When assigning points, playing poker should lead to more discussion only if the point ranges are exceptionally wide.
That could indicate the story is not clear. Otherwise, assign the average and quickly move on. What is ultimately
important to those concerned with capacity/velocity/burndowns is _point averages over time_. Generally, a team's current
capacity is calculated as the average of points completed over the last X sprints.

### Meeting and Ceremony Control

Everyone on team should strive to keep the purpose and context of various meetings and ceremonies in mind. Otherwise,
every meeting has potential of running over its allotted time and doing so repeatedly will cause compounding problems.
Most sprint planning related work should be done in backlog refinement. Subsequent meetings are then mostly painless.
...admittedly, I've rarely seen this done well. One reason is that in a fast-paced team, by the time a story moves from
backlog in to a sprint, the available information and requirements have already changed. But, that's what being agile is
about....and I try to remind myself it's only the processes that are having problems keeping up.

### Estimate High

Prefer to over estimate story points, at least initially. For multiple reasons, it is better for a team to end a sprint
with all stories completed early (uncommon) than it is to end a sprint with stories still-in-progress(very common) or
not started.

At higher levels, planners should generally aim for sprint point allocation at ~75% of average capacity. Developers are
asked to dedicate ~80% of time to project tasks, and leave ~20% for self-development and other important things, like
breathing. That doesn't show up in points (which are relative), but should be kept in mind when considering what can
actually get done in a sprint.

### Story Format

User stories should almost always use the format:

- "As a [persona], I [want to], [so that]."

If it's not written out explicitly, it should be easily inferred. Many teams do not do this, and I've seen that it often
leads to confusion due to different contexts and expectations. This is especially true for teams that are new to Scrum.

A personal practice is to use this even for technical enablement stories. For example:

- "As a DevOp, I want a CI/CD pipeline into Alpha, so that I have a shared environment for automated builds and unit
  tests."

Stories are _generally_ not meant to be Tasks, To Do Items, or Checklists. Generally, a story should describe the
requirement, enhancement, feature, or bug. The team estimates what it would take to resolve the story. A sprint board is
not meant to be a list of tasks to be done for that sprint. It's a list of stories that will be resolved in that sprint,
but the actual work (tasks) it takes to do so does not always need to be part of sprint planning beyond understanding
things well enough to be able to roughly estimate effort required. (Sometimes that does mean developers need to think
through all the required tasks first, but not always.)

### Change is Inevitable

Unexpected change is inevitable in software development. Sometimes that is due to external requirements changing,
sometimes it due to new information, and sometimes it's simply due to unforeseen events. Most often it's because
requirements couldn't be fully understood until work had progressed to some point. A software dev team that expects, and
can react quickly, to change and new information is a good thing.

Processes and tools can cause friction when there is a lot of change. Teams should be frequently assessing and weighing
the pros and cons of any methodology being used. That assessment should be made from the view point of _all_
constituents though. Developers sometimes forget that methodology/process/estimating/planning is important to higher
level business concerns. Management sometimes forget that software development has non-obvious complexities that can
make it hard to estimate or handle changes.

## Common Questions

Below are some common questions to be answered when a team adopts a scum approach. Scrum has answers for all of these
when in larger teams and there are dedicated people assigned to all roles. But in smaller teams, these tend to be useful
questions. It's easy to answer "Product Owner" for most of them, but in my experience, the more a product owner can
delegate, the better.

Q) Who can/should create new stories in the backlog?

Q) Who can/should prioritize new stories in the backlog?

Q) How will new stories be brought to the attention of those prioritizing?

Q) What is the agreed upon hierarchy for epics, stories, tasks, and subtasks?

**Epic** - Estimated with t-shirt sizes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;**Story** - Estimated with points<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Tasks** - Not estimated. Used to show todos/acceptance-criterias/requirements, and sometimes to show progress within a story. Sometimes useful for handling finer-grained pre-requisite relationships and blockers<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Subtasks** - Not used for any planning purposes.<br/>

Q) Can the team add stories/bugs to an active sprint? Should the team modify sprint to reflect actual work?<br/>
_(My recommendation is that changes to active sprint be made infrequently if possible, with high priority bugs being an
exception.)_

_(However, a team should avoid the mindset of "We know it would be best if this was worked on immediately, but it's
not in the current sprint, therefore we'll have to wait." A team should never let the process get in the way of
doing the right thing. However, developers in more formal teams should also recognize that sometimes the coach/manager
has non-obvious reasons for certain priorities. As always... communication is key.)_

Q) Can we change point values of an active sprint story when new information becomes available?<br/>
_(My recommendation is that this is done rarely.)_

Q) When a sprint ends and story is not yet complete, will we move it forward to the next sprint and keep the point value
the same?<br/>
_(My recommendation is, yes, unless new information became available that changed the story significantly. Averages over multiple sprints are what matter. And when there are significant changes that will extend beyond a sprint, it's generally better to break in to new story (or stories).)_
