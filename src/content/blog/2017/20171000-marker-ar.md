<p>
  Video showing a quick experiment with marker image based augmented reality in standard web browsers. (Not
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webxr/">WebXR</a>
  ).
</p>

<div class="video-responsive">

<p>
  In the video, I am using a webcam located on top of the main screen. Anytime the webcam sees the marker, a 3d cube
  is drawn in the camera space and rendered in the camera video feed on the main screen.
</p>
<p>
  Everything in this demo is being done in browser using the
  <a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js">AR.js library</a>
  and newer HTML5 camera APIs. I am using an iPad at the beginning of the video to show the marker image, but then
  towards the end I switched to a print out of the marker to make clear there is no technology component from the
  ipad. The demo would be more compelling if shown using a phone/mobile device (which would use the camera as a
  pass-through to the display containing the 3D image), but my android device camera is dying.

<p>
  <del>The demo does not work with current iOS browsers, but it might be able to work in iOS 11.</del>

<p>
  <strong>UPDATE:[2017-10-21] Confirmed this does now work with iOS 11 Safari browser. </strong>
</p>
<p>This video was done as a live youtube stream from a foscam pan/tilt webcam, streamed using VLC.</p>
